Coding Challenge: Using SQL

In this challenge, you will be tasked with creating SQL queries to be executed against the "Sakila" sample database that comes with MySQL.

Prerequisites:
- MySQL installed on VDE; at least one local server instance running
- MySQL Workbench installed on VDE
- "Sakila" sample database install on local MySQL server instance

Notes on doing these challenges:
- Some of these are simple; some are challenging.
- If you get really stuck on one, move on to another and come back later
- When all is said and done, I'll provide you with the answers so you can check your SQL queries

Challenges:

1. Answer the following questions. Provide the query you used to get each answer:

Which actors have the first name ‘Scarlett’?
Which actors have the last name ‘Johansson’?
How many distinct actors last names are there?
Which last names are not repeated?
Which last names appear more than once?
Which actor has appeared in the most films?
Is ‘Academy Dinosaur’ available for rent from Store 1?

2. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters "LI". Order the rows by last name and first name, in that order.

3. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.

4. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors.

5. The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS. Write a query to fix the record.

6. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all. In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO.

7. Display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China.

8. Use a join to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables named staff and address.
